# Creating synthetic data with Generativ Adversarial Networks (GAN)
In this project i test, if synthetic data can help overcome the issues small datasets have. So i created, with a relativly standard GAN, new elements out of existing ones and compared the performances with a classifier CNN. The dataset used for this is MNIST in a artificially scarced form. (Scripts were written with colab so paths have to be adjusted)
